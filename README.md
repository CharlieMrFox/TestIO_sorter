# TestIO_sorter
This is a simple sorting functionality created through DOM manipulation to help our Onboarding Managers deal with the oldest submissions during the assessing process reducing the response time.

It also contains a search functionality to help group submissions by onboarding people to evaluate the time the submissions were sent and reporting style.

The first version of this functionality was released on March 4th, 2023.
