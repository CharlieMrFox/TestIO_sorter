# TestIO_sorter
This is a simple sorting functionality created through DOM manipulation to help our Onboarding Managers deal with the oldest submissions during the assessing process reducing the response time.

It also contains a search functionality to help group submissions by onboarding people to evaluate the time the submissions were sent and reporting style.

The first version of this functionality was released on March 4th, 2023.

How to use and, what is Tampermonkey? 

Tampermonkey is a popular browser extension that allows you to run user scripts on web pages to modify their behaviour. With Tampermonkey, you can personalise the web browsing experience by adding new features, automating tasks, or removing annoying elements from web pages.
Here are the steps to follow to use Tampermonkey:
1. Install Tampermonkey: Tampermonkey is available for Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge, and other popular browsers. You can download Tampermonkey from the extension store of your browser or the official website of Tampermonkey.
2. Copy this user script: Once you have installed Tampermonkey, go to [TampermonkeyCode.js](https://github.com/CharlieMrFox/TestIO_sorter/blob/main/TampermonkeyCode.js) to install it in your browser. 
3. Install the script: To install this script, simply click on the script’s installation link or copy the script code and paste it into a new Tampermonkey script. Tampermonkey will automatically recognise the script and prompt you to install it.
4. Enable/disable user scripts: Once you have installed a user script, you can enable or disable it anytime. You can do this by clicking the Tampermonkey icon in your browser’s toolbar, selecting the user script you want to enable or disable, and toggling the script’s switch.
5. Update user scripts: Tampermonkey automatically checks for updates to your installed scripts and notifies you when updates are available. You can update your scripts manually or set Tampermonkey to update them automatically.

Tampermonkey has a user-friendly interface and a vast library of user scripts and you can create yours!
